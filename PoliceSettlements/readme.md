In 2017, Randy Furst started putting out requests for data on payouts stemming from police misconduct allegations. 

The goal was to try to get a statewidy tally, over at least a decade, which had never been done before. 

Minneapolis, St. Paul and some other large cities cover these payouts through self insurance -- so we had to get their lists typically from the city attorney offices. 

Smaller cities and counties generally go through the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust and the Minnesota Counties Intergovernmental Trust.  We dealt with Dean Richardson at LMCIT and Robyn Sykes at MCIT

Then we put in requests with:
Minneapolis - Susan Segal, county attorney
St. Paul - Samual Clark, county attorney's office (he is now retired)
Duluth - city attorney's office. 
State Patrol-BCA - Bruce Gordon
Hennepin County - Chuck Laszewski
Anoka County - Erik Thorson
St. Louis County - Thomas Stanley, assistant county attorney
Ramsey county -- Dennis Gerhardstein


From all of them we requested all payouts between Jan 1, 2007 and Dec 31, 2007 stemming from police misconduct allegations. We also asked the counties to include jail officer misconduct allegation payouts and that those be denoted accordingly in the data. 

We put out requests in early summer 2017, but it took months to get data from everybody. By that point it was nearly the end of the year. So we decided to wait until end of 2017 and then circle back to everyone to get an updated batch of data that would go through the end of 2017. 

Some challenges:
We asked all the agencies for the same thing -- including the fields of information we wanted. For example, we asked them to include the name(s) of the officers involved. But each agency sent us something a little different. The only things that held consistent were the year the money was paid out and the amount paid out and the names of the people who got the money (although one agency redacted some names to initials)

St Paul posed a particular headache because the city attorney's office swore up and down, despite my repeated grilling, that they only kept this information in PDFs. But I could never get them to realize that they must have even a Word document that they used to create the PDF in the first place. They gave us two PDFs -- one that was all police-related closed cases (not all of them were for misconduct); the other was all "police civil rights/misconduct cases since 1998", which included open cases. So I turned both of them into excel files and then cross-checked them to see which cases were in both files (or weren't).
